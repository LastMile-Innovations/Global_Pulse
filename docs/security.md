| **Authentication & Authorization (Supabase)** | **CRITICAL: Implement Secure Authentication (`@supabase/ssr`)**              | Use `@supabase/ssr` package for managing auth state via secure, HttpOnly cookies. Implement server/browser clients and the Middleware (`updateSession`) exactly as per official Supabase docs. Enable Email/Phone confirmation if needed. Use Multi-Factor Auth (MFA). | **Foundation:** Prevents session hijacking via XSS (HttpOnly). Ensures consistent auth state across SSR, RSC, Client Components, Server Actions, API Routes. Email confirmation prevents signup spam/impersonation. MFA adds significant account security.                                                                         | **Required** for secure user identity management in **Next.js**. Provides the `user` object needed for authorization checks in **Server Actions/API Routes** and for **Supabase RLS**.                                                                                                           |
|                                               | **CRITICAL: Enforce Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase**                     | **Enable RLS on all tables** with sensitive data (`ALTER TABLE my_table ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`). Define specific policies (`CREATE POLICY ...`) using `auth.uid()`, `auth.role()`, or `auth.jwt() ->> 'claim'` for fine-grained access control. Start with restrictive default-deny policies. Index columns used in `USING` clauses. | **Defense-in-Depth (DB Layer):** Enforces data access rules directly in the database, acting as a fallback even if application-level authorization fails. Prevents users from accessing/modifying data they shouldn't, even via direct DB connection or flawed queries. Protects against insecure direct **Drizzle** queries.          | **Mandatory** for multi-user apps. Complements application-layer checks. **Drizzle** queries respect RLS policies when executed with user context (via `@supabase/ssr`). Optimize RLS policies for performance. Test policies thoroughly using `SET ROLE` in SQL editor.                               |
|                                               | **Use Security Definer Functions Cautiously**                                | Define Supabase Functions with `SECURITY DEFINER` *only* when necessary to perform actions with elevated privileges (e.g., accessing a private table). Grant `EXECUTE` privilege only to specific, trusted roles. Validate inputs rigorously *inside* the function. | **Controlled Privilege Escalation:** Allows specific operations to run as the function owner (often `postgres`), bypassing caller's RLS. **High Risk:** Incorrect implementation can easily lead to major security holes. Input validation is paramount.                                                                                  | Use for specific backend tasks (e.g., admin actions, complex cross-user logic) called perhaps via **Drizzle** `db.execute(sql...)` or directly. Prefer RLS and application logic where possible. Audit carefully.                                                                            |
|                                               | **Manage Custom Roles & Permissions Appropriately**                          | Define custom Postgres roles (`CREATE ROLE...`) if needed beyond basic `authenticated`/`anon`. Grant specific privileges (`GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON ... TO role`) rather than broad access. Use `pgPolicy` in Drizzle schema to link policies to roles. | **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensures application components (or different user types) only have the *minimum necessary permissions* to function, reducing the potential impact of compromised credentials or application flaws.                                                                                                    | Define roles in **Supabase** SQL. Grant permissions relevant to tasks performed by **Drizzle** via the application's DB connection user (if not using user's direct role via RLS exclusively).                                                                                                     |
| **Server Action / API Route Security**        | **CRITICAL: Authorize *Every* Protected Action/Route**                       | **At the start** of every Server Action/API Route needing protection: 1. Get user (`await supabase.auth.getUser()`). 2. Check if user exists (`if (!user) throw/return Error`). 3. Check necessary roles/permissions based on `user` object or claims. 4. Check resource ownership via DB query (e.g., **Drizzle** `where(eq(table.userId, user.id))`). | **Application Layer Auth:** Ensures only authenticated and *authorized* users can trigger specific server-side logic. Prevents users from performing actions on data they don't own or have rights to. Complements RLS.                                                                                                        | **Mandatory.** Uses **Supabase Auth** context provided by `@supabase/ssr` Middleware. Combines with **Drizzle** queries to check ownership/permissions against the database.                                                                                                                         |
|                                               | **CRITICAL: Validate *All* Server-Side Inputs (Zod/Valibot)**              | Use strict schemas (Zod/Valibot, ideally generated from **Drizzle** schema via `drizzle-zod` etc.) to validate *all* data received from the client (FormData, arguments, request body) *inside* the Server Action/API Route. Use `schema.safeParse()`. | **Prevents Injection & Corruption:** Protects against SQL Injection (though Drizzle helps), XSS (if data is reflected), data corruption, unexpected errors, and other injection flaws by ensuring input matches expected format/type/constraints before processing or passing to **Drizzle**/**AI SDK**.                               | **Mandatory.** Use generated **Drizzle** schemas for DB inputs. Define custom schemas for other inputs. Perform validation immediately after authorization checks in **Next.js** Actions/Routes. Return clear validation errors to **React** UI (`useActionState`).                                    |
|                                               | **Use Built-in CSRF Protection (Server Actions via Forms)**                  | Rely on Next.js's automatic CSRF protection when invoking Server Actions via standard `<form action={...}>`.                                                                                                                          | **Mitigates CSRF:** Protects against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks where a malicious site tricks a user into submitting unintended requests to your application.                                                                                                                                                            | Automatically handled by **Next.js** for standard form submissions invoking Server Actions. Be mindful if invoking actions programmatically without standard form patterns (less common).                                                                                                       |
| **Input/Output Handling (XSS Prevention)**    | **Encode Output to Prevent XSS**                                           | **React** automatically escapes data rendered in JSX (`<div>{userData}</div>`). Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless absolutely necessary and *only* with data sanitized server-side using a robust library (e.g., `isomorphic-dompurify`). Be cautious reflecting user input in *any* context (HTML, JS, CSS). | **Prevents Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Ensures user-provided data (from **Drizzle**, **AI SDK**, forms) is treated as text, not executable code, when rendered in the browser. `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` bypasses this protection.                                                                                              | **React** handles basic JSX escaping. Server-side sanitization is crucial if using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Ensure data from **Drizzle/Supabase/AI SDK** is properly handled before rendering in **React**. |
|                                               | **Validate Content-Type and Payload Size**                                 | Server-side (Actions/Routes), check `Content-Type` header for expected values (e.g., `application/json`, `multipart/form-data`). Limit request body size using framework/proxy settings.                                                    | **Prevents Abuse & Resource Exhaustion:** Rejects unexpected request types. Prevents large payload attacks that could exhaust server memory or bandwidth.                                                                    | Configure limits in **Next.js** (`api.bodyParser.sizeLimit`) or underlying server/proxy (Vercel has defaults). Check headers in **API Routes** or **Server Actions** if needed.                               |
| **Session Management**                          | **Rely on Secure, HttpOnly Cookies (`@supabase/ssr`)**                     | Ensure `@supabase/ssr` is configured correctly (Middleware `updateSession`) to manage session cookies. Cookies should be HttpOnly, Secure (in production), SameSite=Lax or Strict.                                                   | **Mitigates XSS Session Theft:** HttpOnly flag prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the session cookie. Secure flag ensures cookie is only sent over HTTPS. SameSite protects against CSRF variants.                                                                                                                        | Handled primarily by **Supabase Auth** via `@supabase/ssr` and **Next.js** Middleware. Verify cookie flags in browser DevTools.                                                                                  |
|                                               | **Manage Session Lifetime & Timeout**                                      | Configure session duration/expiry within **Supabase Auth** settings (JWT expiry). Implement server-side session validation (implicit via `@supabase/ssr` helpers using cookies). Consider shorter session timeouts for sensitive applications. | **Reduces Hijacking Window:** Limits the time an attacker can use a stolen session token. Enforces re-authentication after inactivity.                                                                                      | Configure JWT expiry in **Supabase** dashboard. **@supabase/ssr** handles cookie refresh based on JWT validity. **Redis** can optionally store session *data* with its own TTL, but auth relies on JWT.            |
| **Secret Management**                             | **CRITICAL: Never Expose Secrets Client-Side**                           | Store API keys (**Supabase** service role, **AI SDK** providers, **Redis** token, etc.), JWT secrets in environment variables (`.env.local`, Vercel Env Vars). Access only server-side. Use `server-only` package.                 | **Prevents Key Leakage:** Client-side code is downloadable. Exposing secrets there grants direct access to attackers. `server-only` prevents accidental bundling.                                                              | **Mandatory.** Use `process.env` *only* in **Next.js** server environments (RSC, Actions, API Routes, Middleware). Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix *only* for non-sensitive data intended for the client.             |
|                                               | **Use Supabase Vault for DB-Level Secrets**                                | Store secrets needed *within* Postgres functions or triggers (e.g., external API keys called via `pg_net`) in Supabase Vault. Access via `vault.secrets` table using SQL.                                                        | **Secure Storage within DB:** Provides encrypted storage for secrets needed by DB logic, avoiding hardcoding or storing them insecurely in function definitions.                                                              | Use when **Supabase** Postgres functions/triggers need to call external services or access other secrets. Access within SQL or PL/pgSQL functions.                                                             |
| **Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention**              | **CRITICAL: Implement Robust Rate Limiting (Redis)**                     | Use `@upstash/ratelimit` with **Upstash Redis**. Apply in **Next.js Middleware** (Edge) for earliest protection or at start of Server Actions/API Routes. Key by `user.id` (authed) or IP (`request.ip`). Choose appropriate algorithm (Sliding Window often best). | **Prevents DoS/Brute-Force & Controls Costs:** Protects backend resources (**Supabase/Drizzle**, **AI SDK** LLM APIs) from excessive requests. Ensures fair usage. Mitigates credential stuffing/spam. Manages API costs.                                                                                                     | **Essential.** Apply to login/signup, chat endpoints (**AI SDK**), survey submissions (**Drizzle** writes), any expensive computation or external API call. Leverage **Upstash Redis** speed and distribution.      |
| **Content Security Policy (CSP)**                 | **Implement Strict CSP via Middleware**                                  | Use **Next.js Middleware** (`NextResponse.headers.set`) to define a strict CSP. Start with `default-src 'self';` and explicitly allow origins for scripts (`script-src`), styles (`style-src`), images, fonts, connections (`connect-src`). Use nonces/hashes for inline elements. | **Mitigates XSS:** Controls allowed resource origins and script execution policies, significantly reducing the impact of XSS vulnerabilities by preventing loading/execution of unauthorized resources.                                                                                                                      | Configure centrally in **Next.js Middleware**. Needs careful tuning based on application needs, **React 19** asset loading, `next/image` domains, and third-party scripts loaded via `next/script`.          |
| **Dependency Management**                         | **Regularly Audit & Update Dependencies**                                | Use `npm audit`/`yarn audit`/`pnpm audit` regularly. Enable Dependabot or Snyk for automated vulnerability scanning and update PRs. Vet third-party libraries *before* adding (check maintenance, popularity, known vulns).     | **Patch Known Vulnerabilities:** Dependencies are a common source of security holes. Keeping them updated fixes known flaws. Auditing identifies vulnerable packages in your current tree.                                                                                                                                               | **Essential Hygiene.** Applies to all dependencies: **Next.js**, **React**, **Drizzle**, **AI SDK**, **Redis** client, UI libs, build tools, etc. Integrate checks into CI/CD pipeline.                             |
| **Real-Time Security (WebSockets/Supabase)**      | **Secure Real-Time Channels**                                          | If using custom WebSockets: Use WSS, authenticate connections (JWT), authorize subscriptions server-side. If using **Supabase Realtime**: Rely heavily on RLS policies for subscription authorization (`ALTER PUBLICATION ... ADD TABLE ...`). Validate incoming messages. | **Prevents Unauthorized Access/Publishing:** Ensures only authenticated and authorized users can subscribe to or publish on real-time channels. Protects data confidentiality and integrity.                                                                                                                                      | **Supabase Realtime** integrates tightly with RLS. Custom WebSocket solutions (PartyKit, etc.) require separate auth mechanisms (e.g., passing **Supabase** JWT on connect).                                   |
| **Database Security (Supabase/Postgres)**       | **Use Dedicated DB Roles (Least Privilege)**                           | Avoid using `postgres` superuser role for the application connection pool. Create dedicated roles (`CREATE ROLE my_app WITH LOGIN PASSWORD ...; GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE postgres TO my_app; GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO my_app; GRANT SELECT,...

**Integrated Security Strategy Summary:**

1.  **Foundation (Auth & DB Access):** Use **Supabase Auth (`@supabase/ssr`)** for robust user authentication with secure cookies managed via **Next.js Middleware**. Enforce strict **Supabase RLS** policies as the primary database authorization mechanism, complementing application-level checks.
2.  **Server-Side Defense (Actions/Routes):** In *every* protected **Next.js Server Action/API Route**, re-verify authentication (**Supabase Auth**) and perform specific authorization checks (e.g., ownership via **Drizzle** queries). **Critically**, validate *all* incoming data using **Zod/Valibot** schemas (ideally generated from **Drizzle**).
3.  **Prevent Client-Side Attacks:** Rely on **React**'s automatic JSX escaping. Sanitize rigorously if using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Implement a strict **Content Security Policy (CSP)** via **Next.js Middleware**. Ensure session cookies are HttpOnly (handled by `@supabase/ssr`).
4.  **Protect Resources:** Implement robust **Rate Limiting** using **Upstash Redis** (`@upstash/ratelimit`) in **Next.js Middleware** or Actions/Routes. Configure **Supabase** network restrictions.
5.  **Secure Secrets:** Use environment variables server-side only (`server-only` package). Use **Supabase Vault** for secrets needed within the database itself. **Never** expose secrets to the client.
6.  **Maintain Vigilance:** Regularly audit dependencies, monitor logs (**Supabase**, **Upstash**, Application) for suspicious activity, keep all software updated, and test security controls.

Security is a continuous process, not a one-time setup. By layering defenses across **Next.js**, **React**, **Drizzle**, **Supabase**, and **Redis**, you create a significantly more resilient and secure application.
