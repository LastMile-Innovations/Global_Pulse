# User Stories: Authentication & Profile Management

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Defined (P1 Core)

This document outlines user stories for the Authentication and Profile Management features of Global Pulse, focusing on the end-user perspective for registration, login, session handling, and managing basic settings including marketplace consent, considering the experience within a **Next.js 15 / React 19** application.

---

### 1. Registration

*   **As a new Visitor, I want to easily find a "Sign Up" option, so that I can create an account.**
*   **As a new Visitor, I want to register for an account by providing my email address and choosing a secure password, so that I can access personalized features.**
*   **As a new User, I want clear feedback if my chosen password doesn't meet the required security criteria (e.g., minimum length), so I can correct it.**
*   **As a new User, I may need to verify my email address by clicking a link sent to me, so that the platform confirms I own the email address.**
*   **As a new User, after successful registration (and email verification, if applicable), I want to be automatically logged in or directed to the login page, so I can start using the platform.**

### 2. Login & Logout

*   **As a returning User, I want to easily find a "Login" option, so that I can access my account.**
*   **As a returning User, I want to log in securely using my registered email and password.**
*   **As a returning User, if I enter incorrect login credentials, I want to receive a clear error message without revealing whether the email or password was incorrect, so I understand the login failed but security is maintained.**
*   **As a returning User, upon successful login, I want to be redirected to my personal dashboard (`/dashboard`), so I can immediately see my personalized overview.**
*   **As a logged-in User, I want my session to persist securely as I navigate the site and across browser tabs, so I don't have to log in repeatedly.**
*   **As a logged-in User, I want a clear and accessible "Logout" option, so that I can securely end my session when I'm finished.**
*   **As a logged-in User, after logging out, I want to be redirected to a public page (like the homepage or login page), confirming I am no longer logged in.**

### 3. Password Management

*   **As a User who forgot my password, I want to find a "Forgot Password?" link on the login page, so I can initiate the reset process.**
*   **As a User initiating a password reset, I want to enter my registered email address and receive clear instructions via email on how to proceed.**
*   **As a User resetting my password, I want to click a secure link in the email that takes me to a page (`/update-password`) where I can set a new password.**
*   **As a User setting a new password, I want clear feedback on password strength requirements on the update password page.**
*   **As a User, after successfully setting a new password, I want confirmation and the ability to log in with my new credentials.**

### 4. Profile & Settings Management

*   **As a logged-in User, I want to find a clear link or menu item to access my "Account Settings" or "Profile" page.**
*   **As a logged-in User, I want to view my registered email address on my settings page.**
*   **As a logged-in User, I want the option to change my password securely from within my account settings page.** (*Note: Often handled via separate "Change Password" form/flow*)
*   **As a logged-in User, I want to find a specific section within my settings related to the "Insights Marketplace".**
*   **As a logged-in User, I want to clearly see my current consent status for sharing anonymized structured data in the marketplace (e.g., "Opted In" or "Opted Out").**
*   **As a logged-in User, I want a simple control (like a toggle or checkbox) to easily change my consent status for marketplace participation.**
*   **As a logged-in User, I want clear explanatory text near the consent control explaining what opting in means (anonymized structured data, potential earnings, etc.) and that I can revoke consent anytime.**
*   **As a logged-in User, after changing my consent status, I want immediate visual feedback that the change is processing and confirmation that my setting has been saved successfully (using React `useTransition`).**
