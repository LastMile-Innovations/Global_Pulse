### 1. Overview & Navigation

*   **As a logged-in User, I want to access a personal dashboard, so that I have a central place to view my status and access key platform features.**
*   **As a User, I want my dashboard to load quickly upon login or navigation, so I get immediate access to my personalized overview.**
*   **As a User, I want the dashboard information to be presented clearly and concisely, using cards or distinct sections, so I can easily scan and understand my status and options.**
*   **As a User, I want to see current trending topics or relevant prompts highlighted on my dashboard, so I can quickly discover what's currently active or suggested for participation.**

### 2. Participation Entry Points

*   **As a User, I want clear and prominent buttons or links on my dashboard to start a new conversational chat session (with "Pulse"), so I can easily share my qualitative opinions.**
*   **As a User, I want clear and prominent buttons or links on my dashboard to jump into the dedicated survey feed, so I can quickly contribute structured answers.**
*   **As a User, I might want the dashboard to suggest specific trending topics to start a chat or survey about, so I have clear starting points for engagement.**

### 3. Personal Status & Activity Summary

*   **As a User, I want to see a summary of my recent activity or overall contribution (e.g., number of structured questions answered, number of chat sessions), so I can get a sense of my participation level.**
*   **As a User (Participant/Seller), I want to see a snapshot or summary of my current marketplace earnings directly on the dashboard, so I get quick visibility into the value I'm potentially generating (links to Marketplace feature).**
*   **As a User, I might want to see visual indicators or progress related to my participation goals or streaks (if implemented), so I feel encouraged to contribute regularly.**

### 4. Quick Access & Settings

*   **As a User, I want quick links from my dashboard to manage my account settings (e.g., profile details, consent settings), so I don't have to search through menus.**
*   **As a User, I want a quick link from my dashboard to view my detailed marketplace earnings history (if applicable), so I can easily access that information.**
*   **As a User, I want easy access from the dashboard to the main "Explore" hub, so I can view the aggregated results.**

### 5. Personalization (Potential Future)

*   **As a User (P2/P3), I might want the dashboard to suggest specific topics or survey categories based on my past activity or stated interests, so the experience feels more relevant to me.**
*   **As a User (P3), I might want customizable widgets or sections on my dashboard, so I can prioritize the information most important to me.**
