### 1. Discovery & Navigation

*   **As a User, I want to easily navigate to an "Explore" or "Insights" section, so that I can view the aggregated results of questions asked on the platform.**
*   **As a User, upon visiting the Explore Hub, I want to see an overview of available topics or recently active surveys, so I can quickly find interesting data.**
*   **As a User, I want the Explore Hub to load quickly, presenting available topics/results without noticeable delay, so the platform feels performant.**
*   **As a User, I want to be able to search for specific topics or keywords within the Explore Hub, so I can find results relevant to my interests efficiently.**
*   **As a User, I want filtering options (e.g., by topic category, date range) in the Explore Hub, so I can narrow down the results displayed.**

### 2. Viewing Aggregated Results

*   **As a User, when I select a topic or question in the Explore Hub, I want to see a clear presentation of the original question(s) asked, so I understand the context of the data.**
*   **As a User, I want to see aggregated results displayed using clear and appropriate visualizations (like bar charts, pie charts, or distribution plots), so I can easily understand the overall sentiment or response distribution.**
*   **As a User, I want the charts and data visualizations to load quickly and render smoothly, so I can analyze the insights without frustration.**
*   **As a User, I want to see the total number of responses contributing to an aggregated result, so I can understand the scale and significance of the data.**
*   **As a User viewing results for a currently "live" topic/survey, I want the visualizations to update automatically in near real-time as new answers come in, so I can see the "pulse" changing dynamically.**

### 3. Deeper Understanding & Interpretation

*   **As a User viewing aggregated results, I want an option to request an AI-generated text summary of the key findings, so I can quickly grasp the main takeaways without analyzing raw charts myself.**
*   **As a User (P2), I want an option to generate a dynamic AI-powered dashboard for a topic, presenting curated insights and comparisons in an easily digestible format (using Generative UI components), so I can get a deeper analytical overview.**
*   **As a User (Optional), when viewing aggregated results for a question I have personally answered, I want the option to privately see how my own anonymous response compares to the overall distribution, so I can contextualize my own perspective.**

### 4. Performance & Usability

*   **As a User, I expect all interactions within the Explore Hub (filtering, searching, loading results, generating summaries) to be fast and responsive, contributing to an "instant feel".**
*   **As a User, I want the Explore Hub interface to be intuitive and easy to navigate, even when exploring complex data.**
*   **As a User, I want clear loading indicators (e.g., skeleton screens) when data is being fetched or summaries/dashboards are being generated, so I know the system is working.**
*   **As a User, if data cannot be loaded or an error occurs, I want to see a user-friendly error message instead of a broken interface.**
*   **As a User, I expect the Explore Hub to be accessible and usable across different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).**
