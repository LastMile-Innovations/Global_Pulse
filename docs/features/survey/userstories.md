# User Stories: Dedicated Survey Feed

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Defined (P1 Core)

This document outlines user stories for the Dedicated Survey Feed feature of Global Pulse, focusing on the end-user experience of efficiently answering structured questions. These stories reflect the desired interaction flow and implicitly assume underlying performance optimizations (fast loading, responsive UI) based on the target tech stack.

### 1. Accessing & Navigating the Feed

*   **As a User, I want to easily find and navigate to a dedicated "Surveys" or "Answer Questions" section, so that I can quickly start contributing structured data.**
*   **As a User, I want the survey feed interface to load quickly, so that I can start answering questions without unnecessary waiting.**
*   **As a User, I want to be presented with one clear question at a time, so that I can focus on providing a thoughtful answer without feeling overwhelmed.**

### 2. Filtering & Question Relevance

*   **As a User, I want the option to filter the questions presented to me by topic or category, so that I can focus on areas I'm most interested in or knowledgeable about.**
*   **As a User, I expect the questions presented in the feed to be relevant based on my selected filters.**
*   **As a User, I want the system to remember which questions I've already answered (across both chat and survey modes), so that I am not repeatedly asked the same question.**

### 3. Answering Questions

*   **As a User, I want to see the question displayed clearly along with the appropriate interactive control (e.g., radio buttons for multiple choice, a slider for scales, buttons for simple choices), so that I understand how to provide my answer.**
*   **As a User, I want interacting with the answer controls (clicking, sliding) to feel smooth and immediate.**
*   **As a User, I want a clear "Submit" or "Next" button to confirm my answer and move to the next question.**
*   **As a User, I want the submission process to feel fast and keep the interface responsive, so I don't experience UI freezes while my answer is being saved (thanks to `useTransition`).**

### 4. Feed Flow & Feedback

*   **As a User, after submitting an answer, I want the interface to automatically and smoothly transition to the next available question matching my filters, so that I can maintain a continuous flow.**
*   **As a User, I want to see a subtle loading indicator (like a skeleton screen) while the next question is being fetched, so I know the system is working.**
*   **As a User, when I have answered all available questions matching my filters, I want to see a clear message indicating completion (e.g., "You're all caught up!"), so I know I'm done for now.**
*   **As a User, if there's an error submitting my answer or fetching the next question, I want to see a user-friendly error message and potentially have an option to retry, so I'm not stuck.**

### 5. Overall Experience

*   **As a User, I want the survey feed experience to be efficient and straightforward, allowing me to contribute data quickly without the conversational depth of the chat.**
*   **As a User, I appreciate that my contributions here add to the same data pool as the chat, making my participation valuable regardless of the mode I choose.**
