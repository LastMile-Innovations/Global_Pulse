# Requirements Document: Conversational Chat Interface

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Requirements Defined (P1 Core, P3 Research Tools)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Global Pulse "Conversational Chat Interface" feature. This interface is the primary mechanism for dynamic, AI-led engagement, allowing the collection of nuanced qualitative feedback alongside structured quantitative data via embedded components.

## 2. Goals

*   Provide an intuitive and engaging real-time chat experience for users.
*   Facilitate natural language conversations with the AI agent ("Pulse") to understand user perspectives deeply.
*   Seamlessly integrate structured data collection (via Generative UI) within the conversational flow.
*   Ensure the AI agent maintains strict neutrality and objectivity.
*   Leverage AI capabilities for intelligent question sourcing and contextual understanding.
*   Contribute high-quality qualitative and quantitative data to the Global Pulse platform.

## 3. Functional Requirements (FR)

*   **REQ-CHAT-01:** The system must provide a real-time chat interface for users to interact with the AI agent ("Pulse").
*   **REQ-CHAT-02:** Users must be able to send text messages to the Pulse agent via an input field.
*   **REQ-CHAT-03:** The Pulse agent must respond to user messages in a streaming, token-by-token manner to provide immediate feedback.
*   **REQ-CHAT-04:** The Pulse agent must strictly adhere to its defined neutral, inquisitive, and objective persona based on its system prompt. It must not express opinions or lead the user.
*   **REQ-CHAT-05:** The Pulse agent must maintain conversational context throughout a single chat session, using the provided message history.
*   **REQ-CHAT-06:** The system may display relevant trending topics upon chat initiation to help users start conversations.
*   **REQ-CHAT-07 (P3):** The Pulse agent must be able to invoke defined external tools (e.g., Web Search, News API) when its logic determines external context is needed.
*   **REQ-CHAT-08 (P3):** The Pulse agent must present information gathered from external tools neutrally, concisely, and always followed by a user-centric question.
*   **REQ-CHAT-09:** The Pulse agent must identify opportunities within the conversation to ask relevant structured questions.
*   **REQ-CHAT-10 (Intelligent Sourcing):** Before generating a new structured question, the Pulse agent's backend logic must query the Questions database to find a suitable existing question that the current user has not already answered.
*   **REQ-CHAT-11 (Generation Fallback):** If no suitable existing question is found via sourcing, the Pulse agent must use its LLM capabilities to generate a new structured question definition based on the conversational context.
*   **REQ-CHAT-12 (Persistence):** Newly generated question definitions must be saved to the central Questions database for future reuse.
*   **REQ-CHAT-13 (GenUI Invocation):** The Pulse agent must invoke the appropriate Generative UI tool (e.g., `displayMultipleChoice`, `displaySliderScale`) corresponding to the sourced or generated question, passing necessary parameters (questionId, text, options).
*   **REQ-CHAT-14 (GenUI Rendering):** The chat interface frontend must correctly render the specified interactive Generative UI component inline within the agent's message bubble based on the received tool invocation.
*   **REQ-CHAT-15 (GenUI Interaction):** Users must be able to interact with the embedded GenUI components (e.g., click options, move sliders) directly within the chat interface.
*   **REQ-CHAT-16 (Answer Submission):** User interaction with a GenUI component must trigger the submission of the structured answer (including `userId`, `questionId`, `answerValue`, `chatId`, and `source='chat'`) to the dedicated backend endpoint (`/api/survey/answer` or Server Action `submitSurveyResponse`).

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

*   **REQ-NFR-CHAT-PERF-01 (Responsiveness):** The chat interface must feel highly responsive. User messages should appear instantly. AI response streaming should begin quickly (target < 1 second for first token). GenUI components must render without noticeable lag.
*   **REQ-NFR-CHAT-PERF-02 (Scalability):** The backend API handling chat requests (`/api/chat/[id]/route.ts`) must scale to handle a large number of concurrent chat sessions and LLM API calls.
*   **REQ-NFR-CHAT-REL-01 (Reliability):** The chat system must gracefully handle potential errors during LLM calls, tool executions (including DB queries for question sourcing/saving), or stream processing. Users should receive informative error messages.
*   **REQ-NFR-CHAT-SEC-01 (Security):** All chat API requests must be authenticated and authorized. Chat history associated with a user must be protected via RLS. API keys for LLMs and external tools must be handled securely on the backend.
*   **REQ-NFR-CHAT-PRIV-01 (Privacy):** Chat transcripts must be stored securely. If transcripts are used for analysis or marketplace pooling (P2/P3), a separate, explicit user consent and robust anonymization process is required.
*   **REQ-NFR-CHAT-USE-01 (Usability):** The chat interface must be intuitive and follow common chat UI conventions. Scrolling, input handling, and interaction with GenUI must be smooth.
*   **REQ-NFR-CHAT-NEUTRAL-01 (AI Neutrality):** The implementation of the Pulse agent (prompting, potentially fine-tuning) must be rigorously designed and tested to ensure consistent neutrality and objectivity, avoiding the introduction of bias.
*   **REQ-NFR-CHAT-ACC-01 (Accessibility):** The chat interface, including text messages and interactive GenUI components, must adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.
