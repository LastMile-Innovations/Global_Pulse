This document outlines user stories for the Conversational Chat Interface feature of Global Pulse, focusing on the perspective of the end-user interacting with the AI agent "Pulse".

---

### 1. Initiating & Basic Chat Interaction

*   **As a User, I want to start a chat about a specific trending topic, so that I can easily engage with current events.**
*   **As a User, I want to start an open-ended chat without selecting a predefined topic, so that I can discuss something specific on my mind.**
*   **As a User, I want to see my typed message appear immediately in the chat interface, so that I know my input is registered.**
*   **As a User, I want to see the AI's ("Pulse") responses appear quickly after I send my message, ideally streaming in real-time, so that the conversation feels dynamic and engaging.**
*   **As a User, I want the chat interface to automatically scroll to the latest message, so that I don't have to manually scroll down constantly.**
*   **As a User, I want the chat history within my current session to be visible, so that I can easily refer back to previous points in the conversation.**

### 2. Interacting with the AI Agent ("Pulse")

*   **As a User, I want Pulse to ask me open-ended questions initially, so that I can express my thoughts freely without being led.**
*   **As a User, I want Pulse to ask relevant follow-up or clarifying questions based on my responses, so that the conversation feels coherent and understood.**
*   **As a User, I want Pulse to remain neutral and objective throughout the conversation, so that I feel comfortable sharing my honest perspective without judgment or bias.**
*   **As a User, I want Pulse to understand the context of our ongoing conversation within the current session, so that I don't have to repeat information unnecessarily.**
*   **As a User, I want to understand when Pulse is processing my request, so that I see a loading indicator instead of just waiting.**
*   **As a User, I want to receive a clear message if Pulse encounters an error or cannot proceed, so that I understand the situation.**
*   **As a User (P3), I want Pulse to occasionally provide brief, neutral factual context related to our discussion (e.g., from news or web search), so that the conversation can be more informed.**

### 3. Interacting with Embedded Generative UI (GenUI)

*   **As a User, I want to see interactive elements (like polls, sliders, buttons) appear directly within Pulse's chat messages when it asks specific structured questions, so that I can answer them easily within the flow.**
*   **As a User, I want to be able to interact with these embedded UI elements (e.g., click a multiple-choice option, drag a slider) directly in the chat window, so that I don't have to navigate elsewhere.**
*   **As a User, I want the embedded UI element to provide feedback that my answer has been registered (e.g., disabling options, showing my selection), so that I know my input was captured.**
*   **As a User, I want the conversation with Pulse to continue naturally after I interact with an embedded UI element, so that the structured questions feel like a seamless part of the dialogue.**
*   **As a User, I expect the structured questions asked via GenUI to be relevant to the topic we are currently discussing, so that they don't feel random or out of place.**

### 4. Error Handling & Recovery

*   **As a User, if the chat connection fails or an error occurs, I want to see a clear error message explaining the issue (if possible), so that I'm not left wondering what happened.**
*   **As a User, if an error occurs after I submit a message, I want the option to easily retry sending my last message, so that I don't have to retype it.**
