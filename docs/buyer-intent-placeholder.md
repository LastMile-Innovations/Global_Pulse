# Ethical Buyer Intent Declaration Form & Policy Placeholder

This feature provides a clear, ethically-grounded initial contact point for potential data monetization pathways before any such products exist. It establishes a mechanism for vetting potential buyers based on intended use and ethical considerations.

## Components

### 1. Data Use Policy Page

A static page that outlines the future intent and ethical principles governing potential use/sale of anonymized aggregate data. The page explains:

- The platform's commitment to privacy and user control
- That only anonymized, aggregated data from users who explicitly opt-in would ever be considered for such products
- That raw/identifiable data is NEVER sold
- The ethical principles guiding data use (non-maleficence, fairness, transparency)
- The requirement for potential buyers to undergo strict vetting and agree to usage limitations
- A statement that no such data products currently exist (MVP status)

### 2. Request Data Access Form

A public-facing form for inquiries that collects:

- Contact Name
- Organization Name
- Contact Email
- Contact Phone (optional)
- Intent Declaration (a detailed explanation of intended use, end-users, ethical alignment, and safeguards)
- Policy Acknowledgment (a mandatory checkbox)

### 3. Database Schema

A PostgreSQL table (`DataAccessRequest`) that stores:

- Request ID
- Creation Timestamp
- Contact Information
- Intent Declaration
- Policy Acknowledgment
- Status (Pending, Reviewed, Approved, Rejected)
- Internal Notes

### 4. Admin Interface

A simple admin interface that allows platform administrators to:

- View all data access requests
- View detailed information about each request
- Update the status of requests
- Add internal notes

### 5. Email Notifications

An email notification system that alerts administrators when a new data access request is submitted.

## Workflow

1. A potential buyer navigates to the `/request-data-access` page
2. They fill out the form, including a detailed intent declaration
3. They acknowledge the data use policy
4. They submit the form
5. The form data is validated and stored in the database
6. An email notification is sent to the platform administrators
7. Administrators can review the request and update its status

## Ethical Considerations

This feature is designed with several ethical considerations in mind:

- **Transparency**: The data use policy clearly outlines the platform's ethical principles and intentions
- **User Control**: The policy emphasizes that only data from users who explicitly opt-in would be used
- **Vetting**: The form collects detailed information to enable thorough vetting of potential buyers
- **No Automatic Access**: The form submission does not grant any actual data access; it only collects inquiries for future manual vetting

## Technical Implementation

The feature is implemented using:

- Next.js for the frontend
- Prisma for database interactions
- Resend for email notifications
- PostgreSQL for data storage

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements include:

- More sophisticated vetting processes
- Integration with a CRM system
- Automated background checks on requesting organizations
- More detailed analytics on request patterns
