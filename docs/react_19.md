| **Fundamentals & Purity**                         | **CRITICAL: Write Pure Components & Hooks**                              | Components/hooks should always return the same output for the same inputs and have no side effects during rendering (e.g., no mutations of props/state/refs, no API calls). `function MyComponent({ prop }) { /* pure logic */ return ...; }`          | **Foundation for Reliability & Optimization:** Predictable rendering behavior. **Enables React Compiler** optimizations (auto-memoization). Prevents bugs caused by unexpected side effects. Easier to test and reason about.                                                                                                      | **Essential** for leveraging React Compiler benefits. Pure components work seamlessly as both **Server Components** and **Client Components** in Next.js. Ensures predictable UI updates after data fetching (**Drizzle**) or **Server Actions**.                                                            |
|                                                   | **Embrace & Optimize for React 19 Compiler (`reactCompiler: true`)**       | Ensure `reactCompiler: true` in `next.config.js`. Write pure, rule-abiding components/hooks. Let compiler handle memoization. Use `'use memo'` for opt-in during migration or for specific complex cases. Use ESLint plugin (`eslint-plugin-react-compiler`). | **Automatic Memoization:** Significantly reduces re-renders *without* manual `useMemo`/`useCallback`/`memo`. Improves rendering throughput, reduces client CPU usage, simplifies code. The primary optimization strategy in React 19+.                                                                                             | **Default Strategy.** Requires strict adherence to React Rules. Reduces need for manual memoization, making code cleaner. Improves responsiveness of Client Components in **Next.js**. Faster UI updates after data loading or **Server Action** completion.                                          |
|                                                   | **Use Strict Mode in Development (`<StrictMode>`)**                      | Wrap application root or specific subtrees in `<StrictMode>` in `app/layout.tsx` or client entry point.                                                                                                                                                | **Highlights Potential Problems:** Runs effects/initializers twice in dev to find missing cleanup. Detects unsafe lifecycles, legacy APIs, unexpected side effects, deprecated APIs. Helps ensure components are pure and resilient.                                                                                             | **Always enable in development.** Helps catch bugs related to state, effects, and purity *before* they impact production performance or correctness. Crucial for ensuring components work well with the React Compiler and Concurrent Features.                                                             |
| **State Management**                              | **CRITICAL: Update State Immutably**                                     | **Always create new objects/arrays:** Use spread syntax (`{...state, prop: newVal}`, `[...arr, newItem]`), `map`, `filter`. Avoid direct mutation (`state.prop = x`, `arr.push(y)`).                                                    | **Essential for Change Detection:** React relies on reference equality to detect state changes and trigger re-renders. Mutation bypasses this, leading to stale UI and bugs. Ensures predictable state updates.                                                                                                                    | **Mandatory.** Incorrect mutation breaks React's rendering model, leading to UI inconsistencies when displaying data fetched via **Drizzle** or updated via **Server Actions**.                                                                                                                          |
|                                                   | **Use Updater Functions for State Based on Previous State**              | Use the function form of state setters: `setCount(c => c + 1); setItems(items => [...items, newItem]);`.                                                                                                                                      | **Ensures Correct State Updates:** Guarantees the update uses the latest state value, especially important for batched updates or updates triggered close together. Avoids bugs related to stale closures in event handlers/effects.                                                                                                | **Best Practice** whenever the new state depends on the previous state (counters, toggles, adding/removing items). Prevents race conditions in event handlers triggering **Server Actions** or client-side updates.                                                                                  |
|                                                   | **Choose State Hooks Appropriately (`useState` vs `useReducer`)**        | Use `useState` for simple, independent state. Use `useReducer` for complex state logic, multiple related fields, or when next state depends heavily on previous state/action type.                                                         | **Organization & Predictability:** `useReducer` centralizes update logic, making complex transitions easier to manage and test. Can improve performance by passing `dispatch` down instead of multiple callbacks (though Compiler mitigates this).                                                                                | `useState` is fine for most component-local state. Consider `useReducer` for managing complex client-side state, like the Global Pulse chat interface state or multi-step survey forms, potentially interacting with **Server Actions**.                                                               |
|                                                   | **Avoid Redundant State (Derive During Render)**                           | Calculate values directly during rendering if they can be derived purely from props or existing state. `const fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName;` instead of storing `fullName` in state.                                         | **Simplicity & Consistency:** Reduces state synchronization complexity and potential bugs. Avoids unnecessary re-renders caused by setting derived state in Effects. Makes component logic easier to follow.                                                                                                                        | Apply when values can be computed directly from props or state. Simplifies components displaying data fetched via **Drizzle** or derived from user inputs before sending to a **Server Action**.              |
|                                                   | **Initialize State Lazily (`useState(initFn)`)**                         | Pass a function to `useState` or `useReducer` for expensive initial state calculations: `const [todos, setTodos] = useState(createInitialTodos);`.                                                                                   | **Performance:** The initializer function runs *only once* during the initial render, avoiding expensive computations on subsequent re-renders.                                                                                                                                                                                          | Use when the initial state requires non-trivial computation, data transformation, or reading from potentially slow sources like `localStorage` (though prefer server state where possible).                 |
|                                                   | **Consider Immer (`useImmer`, `useImmerReducer`) for Complex Updates** | Use `useImmer` or `useImmerReducer` to update nested/complex state using seemingly mutable syntax while ensuring immutability under the hood. `updatePerson(draft => { draft.address.city = 'New City'; });`                             | **Developer Experience & Reduced Boilerplate:** Simplifies updating deeply nested state objects or arrays compared to manual spreading, reducing potential errors while maintaining immutability benefits.                                                                                                                            | Useful for complex client-side state structures, like editing nested data fetched via **Drizzle** before submitting updates via **Server Actions**, or managing complex UI state (e.g., form builders, editors). |
| **Rendering Optimization**                        | **Rely on React Compiler for Memoization (Primary)**                   | Write pure components. Trust the compiler to handle memoization of components and hook return values.                                                                                                                            | **Default & Best:** The compiler is designed to optimize memoization automatically and more effectively than manual approaches in many cases.                                                                               | **Always prioritize** writing pure, rule-abiding code. Let the compiler do the heavy lifting for optimizing re-renders in Client Components within **Next.js**.                                                |
|                                                   | **Use Manual Memoization Sparingly (`memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`)**  | Apply `memo` to components, `useMemo` to values, `useCallback` to functions *if profiling reveals bottlenecks* not handled by the compiler. Pass stable props to memoized children.                                                  | **Targeted Optimization:** Prevents specific, identified unnecessary re-renders or expensive recalculations. Can be crucial for complex visualizations or components receiving unstable props.                                                                                                                                          | Use *only after profiling* identifies a specific performance issue in a Client Component. Compiler often makes these unnecessary. Ensure dependencies are correctly specified. Use to stabilize props passed down, especially non-primitive values.                                                  |
|                                                   | **Stabilize Props Passed to Memoized Components**                      | If manually memoizing (`memo`), ensure props passed down are stable. Use `useMemo` for objects/arrays, `useCallback` for functions passed as props. Primitives are inherently stable.                                                | **Enables `memo`:** `React.memo` only works effectively if the props it receives have stable references. Unstable props (new objects/arrays/functions on every render) defeat memoization.                                                                                                                                        | Required if using `React.memo` manually. The React Compiler aims to stabilize values automatically, reducing the need for this, but it's good practice if compiler isn't active or for complex scenarios.     |
|                                                   | **Use Stable `key` Props for Lists**                                     | Use stable, unique identifiers from your data (`item.id` from **Drizzle**) as the `key` prop when rendering lists. Avoid using index (`map((item, index) => <li key={index}>...)`) if list order/content can change.           | **Performance & Correctness:** Helps React efficiently update, add, or remove list items by identifying instances across renders. Prevents state mixing/loss issues when list order changes. Essential for performance with large/dynamic lists.                                                                                | **Mandatory** when rendering lists from arrays in **React**. Use stable IDs from database records (fetched via **Drizzle**) or generated unique IDs.                                                          |
|                                                   | **Use `key` Prop to Reset Component State Intentionally**                | Change the `key` prop on a component instance (`<Profile key={userId} />`) to force React to unmount the old instance and mount a new one with fresh state.                                                                    | Provides a simple, declarative way to fully reset a component's internal state when its primary identifier changes, avoiding complex manual state resetting logic in `useEffect`.                                          | Useful for detail pages, forms tied to a specific entity, or components where internal state needs a full reset when the main subject changes (e.g., switching user profiles fetched via **Drizzle**).          |
| **UI Responsiveness & Concurrency**               | **Use `useTransition` for Non-Blocking Updates/Actions**               | Wrap state updates triggering slow renders or **Server Action** calls in `startTransition`. Use `isPending` for visual feedback. `const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition(); startTransition(() => { setTab('posts'); });` | **Improves INP & Responsiveness:** Keeps the UI interactive during slow rendering updates or background work (like **Server Action** execution). Prevents freezing the interface. Provides loading state indicators.          | **Crucial** for updates triggering heavy computations, slow re-renders (e.g., large lists/charts), or initiating **Server Actions**. Essential for maintaining a responsive UI feel.                               |
|                                                   | **Use `useDeferredValue` for Deferring Non-Critical Renders**        | Wrap state values that cause slow re-renders: `const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query); <SlowList text={deferredQuery} />`. Indicate staleness if needed (`query !== deferredQuery`).                                      | **Keeps UI Responsive:** Allows urgent updates (like typing in an input) to render immediately, while deferring the rendering of components using the deferred value until the browser is idle. Better UX than blocking UI or excessive loading spinners.                                                                        | Use when a state update (e.g., search query) triggers a component that renders slowly (e.g., filtering/displaying large lists fetched from **Drizzle/Redis**) and showing slightly stale data temporarily is acceptable. |
| **Effects (`useEffect`, `useLayoutEffect`)**      | **Specify Dependencies Correctly**                                       | Include *all* reactive values (props, state, functions defined in component scope) read by the Effect in the dependency array. Use ESLint plugin (`react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`) to enforce this.                             | **Prevents Stale Closures & Ensures Synchronization:** Ensures the Effect re-runs when any value it depends on changes. Missing dependencies lead to bugs where the Effect uses outdated values. Unnecessary dependencies cause excessive re-runs.                                                                              | **Mandatory.** Incorrect dependencies often lead to bugs where UI doesn't update after data changes (**Drizzle** fetches, **Server Action** results propagated to client state).                                  |
|                                                   | **Implement Cleanup Functions**                                        | Return a function from `useEffect` to clean up resources (subscriptions, timers, connections). `return () => connection.disconnect();`. Ensure cleanup logic mirrors setup logic.                                              | **Prevents Memory Leaks & Bugs:** Cleans up subscriptions, timers, or connections when the component unmounts or before the effect re-runs, avoiding zombie listeners or resource leaks.                                 | **Essential** for any Effect that sets up subscriptions (WebSockets, event listeners like `window.addEventListener`), timers (`setInterval`), or external connections.                                        |
|                                                   | **Separate Concerns into Multiple Effects**                              | Use multiple `useEffect` hooks for unrelated synchronization logic. E.g., one effect for data fetching, another for event listeners.                                                                                         | **Improved Readability & Maintainability:** Makes code easier to understand and debug. Allows specifying different dependencies for different synchronization tasks, avoiding unnecessary re-runs of unrelated logic.         | Apply when a component needs to synchronize with multiple independent external systems or data sources.                                                                                                       |
|                                                   | **Avoid Effects for Events/Simple Computations**                         | Handle user events (clicks, submits) in event handlers. Calculate derived data directly during rendering. Don't use Effects for simple state transformations based on props/state.                                               | **Simplicity & Performance:** Event handlers are the correct place for event-specific logic. Calculating during render is simpler and avoids extra render cycles caused by setting state in Effects.                      | **Refactor** logic out of Effects if it only needs to run on specific events or can be calculated during render. Trigger **Server Actions** from event handlers, not Effects.                               |
|                                                   | **Use `useEffectEvent` (Experimental) for Non-Reactive Logic**         | Wrap functions read inside `useEffect` that shouldn't trigger re-syncs with `useEffectEvent`. `const onVisit = useEffectEvent(url => logVisit(url, count)); useEffect(() => { onVisit(url); }, [url]);`                           | **Removes Unnecessary Dependencies:** Allows Effects to read the latest value of props/state *without* needing to include them in the dependency array, preventing unwanted re-runs (e.g., logging, analytics).             | Experimental. Useful when an Effect needs to call a function that depends on props/state which change often, but the Effect itself should only re-run based on other dependencies (e.g., `roomId` but not `theme`). |
|                                                   | **Use `useLayoutEffect` Cautiously**                                   | Use `useLayoutEffect` *only* for reading layout from the DOM and synchronously re-rendering *before* the browser paints (e.g., measuring tooltips, positioning elements based on layout).                                        | **Prevents Visual Flickers:** Useful for layout measurements that need to be applied before paint. **Blocks Browser Paint:** Can negatively impact performance if overused or if logic inside is slow. `useEffect` is preferred. | **Rarely needed.** Profile first. Use only when `useEffect` causes unavoidable visual flickering due to layout calculations happening *after* paint.                                                        |
| **Context**                                       | **Optimize Context Value Stability (`useMemo`)**                         | Memoize the context value passed to the Provider if it's an object or array created during render: `const value = useMemo(() => ({ user, login }), [user, login]); <Ctx.Provider value={value}>`.                              | **Prevents Unnecessary Re-renders:** Prevents all consumers of the context from re-rendering every time the Provider's parent re-renders, even if the context data hasn't actually changed.                                 | **Essential** when providing non-primitive values (objects, arrays, functions) via Context Provider to avoid performance degradation in consumers. React Compiler may help automate this.                     |
|                                                   | **Split Contexts for Granularity**                                     | Create multiple, smaller contexts for unrelated state (e.g., `ThemeContext`, `AuthContext`) instead of one large context object.                                                                                           | **Reduces Unnecessary Re-renders:** Components consuming only one part of the state won't re-render when unrelated parts of the state change in a different context. Improves modularity.                               | Apply when application state can be logically grouped into independent domains.                                                                                                                                |
| **Refs (`useRef`, `forwardRef`, `useImperativeHandle`)** | **Use Refs for DOM Access / Imperative Actions**                   | Use `useRef` to get direct access to DOM nodes (`inputRef.current.focus()`) or to store mutable values that *don't* trigger re-renders (interval IDs, previous state).                                                         | **DOM Manipulation & Persistent Values:** Provides an escape hatch for direct DOM interaction (focus, measurements, integrating third-party libs). Stores values across renders without causing re-renders.               | Use for focusing inputs, measuring elements, integrating non-React libraries requiring DOM nodes, storing timeouts/intervals.                                                                         |
|                                                   | **Avoid Refs for Declarative State**                                     | Don't use refs to store information you want to display in JSX. State (`useState`, `useReducer`) should be used for data that affects rendering.                                                                           | **Predictable Rendering:** React doesn't re-render when refs change. Using refs for rendering logic leads to stale UI. State ensures UI updates declaratively when data changes.                                       | **Always.** If the data needs to be displayed or affect the rendered output, use state, not refs.                                                                                                             |
|                                                   | **Use `forwardRef` / `ref` Prop (React 19) for DOM Exposure**          | **React 19:** Pass `ref` directly as a prop to function components: `function MyInput({ ref }) { return <input ref={ref} />; }`. **Older:** Use `forwardRef` HOC: `const MyInput = forwardRef((props, ref) => <input ref={ref} />);` | **Component Encapsulation:** Allows parent components to get refs to DOM nodes rendered *inside* child components, enabling coordination (e.g., focusing child input from parent). React 19 simplifies this significantly.  | Use when a parent component needs direct DOM access to an element rendered by a child component. Prefer the new `ref` prop in React 19.                                                                    |
|                                                   | **Limit Exposed Handle with `useImperativeHandle`**                    | Inside a `forwardRef` component, use `useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({ customFocus: () => {...} }), [])` to expose only specific methods, not the entire DOM node.                                                     | **Encapsulation & Safety:** Hides internal DOM structure and exposes a limited, intentional API to the parent, making the component less brittle and safer to refactor internally.                                      | Use when you need to expose imperative functionality from a child but want to avoid giving the parent full DOM node access.                                                                               |
| **React 19 Specifics**                            | **Embrace React Actions (`action` prop, `useActionState`, `useFormStatus`)** | Use `<form action={serverOrClientAction}>`. Use `useActionState` for state tied to action result/errors. Use `useFormStatus` inside `<form>` for pending/data access.                                                         | **Integrated Form Handling:** Simplifies form submissions, pending states, error handling, and optimistic updates. Works seamlessly with **Server Actions**. Supports progressive enhancement.                               | **Recommended** approach for forms in React 19, especially when interacting with **Server Actions**. Replaces complex manual state management for form submissions.                                       |
|                                                   | **Use `use` API for Promises/Context (Client Components)**             | Read promise results or context values directly within Client Components: `const user = use(userPromise); const theme = use(ThemeContext);`. Integrates with Suspense.                                                      | **Simplifies Async/Context Consumption:** Allows reading promises/context within conditional logic. Suspends rendering until resource is ready. Cleaner than `useEffect` for fetch-on-render or complex context access.      | Use in Client Components (`'use client'`) to consume promises passed from Server Components or context values, especially within loops or conditionals. Requires Suspense boundary for promises.               |
|                                                   | **Leverage Built-in Asset Loading (`<link>`, `<script>`)**             | Use `<link rel="stylesheet" href="..." precedence="medium" />`, `<script async src="..." />` directly in components. React handles hoisting, deduplication, Suspense integration, and load order (`precedence`).          | **Optimized Resource Loading:** Native browser support. Improves performance by handling resource loading efficiently (deduping, prioritization, non-blocking). Integrates with Suspense for coordinated loading states.    | **Recommended** way to include CSS and JS in React 19 components. Replaces manual management in `<head>` or `next/head`. Complements **Next.js** built-in asset handling (`next/font`, `next/image`).            |
| **Development & Debugging**                       | **Use React DevTools Profiler**                                      | Use the Profiler tab in browser DevTools to record and analyze component render times and commit phases. Identify "why did this render?" reasons. Measure impact of memoization.                                          | **Identify Performance Bottlenecks:** Pinpoints slow components and unnecessary re-renders. Provides concrete data for optimizing rendering performance.                                                                | Use whenever investigating client-side rendering performance issues or validating the effectiveness of memoization techniques (manual or compiler-driven).                                                   |
|                                                   | **Use `useDebugValue` in Custom Hooks**                                | Add `useDebugValue(value, format?)` inside custom hooks to display helpful labels in React DevTools. `useDebugValue(isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline');`                                                                    | **Improved Debugging:** Makes custom hooks easier to inspect in DevTools, showing relevant internal state or computed values directly. Defer formatting for expensive calculations.                                        | Apply to custom hooks to improve their debuggability, especially hooks managing complex state or logic.                                                                                                     |

**Integrated React Strategy Summary:**

React 19, especially with the Compiler, shifts the focus towards writing **pure, rule-abiding components** and letting the framework handle optimization.

1.  **Compiler First:** Prioritize purity and rely on the React Compiler for automatic memoization. Use manual memoization (`memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`) only as a fallback after profiling identifies specific bottlenecks.
2.  **State Management Fundamentals:** Always update state immutably. Use updater functions when necessary. Choose `useState` or `useReducer` appropriately. Derive state during render where possible. Consider `useImmer` for complex nested updates.
3.  **Concurrency for Responsiveness:** Leverage `useTransition` extensively for Server Action calls and state updates triggering slow renders to keep the UI interactive (improves INP). Use `useDeferredValue` for non-critical slow rendering components to avoid blocking urgent updates.
4.  **Effects for Synchronization:** Use `useEffect` primarily for synchronizing with external systems (DOM, network, third-party libs). Ensure correct dependencies and cleanup functions. Avoid effects for event handling or simple computations. Use `useEffectEvent` (experimental) to decouple non-reactive logic.
5.  **Leverage React 19 Features:** Utilize Actions (`<form action>`, `useActionState`, `useFormStatus`) for streamlined form handling, especially with **Server Actions**. Use the `use` hook in Client Components for cleaner promise/context consumption. Use built-in `<link>` and `<script>` for optimized asset loading.
6.  **Keys for Lists:** Always use stable, unique keys when rendering lists (e.g., IDs from **Drizzle** data).
7.  **Debugging & Development:** Use `StrictMode` always in development. Use the React DevTools Profiler to analyze rendering performance. Add `useDebugValue` to custom hooks.

By following these React-specific practices within the broader Next.js/Drizzle/Supabase/Redis architecture, you ensure the UI layer is efficient, responsive, and works harmoniously with server-side logic and data fetching, contributing significantly to the overall "instant feel".
